    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Traveling to another country is one of the most exciting experiences that everyone must try at least once in a lifetime. As an American, it can be very hard because most countries require flying for multiple hours or even having to stay for longer times to make your trip worth the time and money. With Covid-19, it is even more worrisome on traveling across the world however with how unsafe it may seem, I have happened to travel 3 times to Italy. And with the opening of the border, there are still rules with airlines to different countries. I am going to show you how to travel to Italy from the United States while saving the most amount of money possible.</p>

    <h1>Pre-Departure </h1> <a name= "BookingSection"> </a> <h4> Booking </h4>
        <p>Booking is almost the same as traveling domestically in the United States. The earlier you book, the better the cost of the flight. <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/flights"> Google Flights</a> shows many options for Airlines. My reason for choosing <a href="https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-it/flights/booking/">Turkish Airlines</a> is because they have very awesome baggage policies. You are allowed 2 checked bags, 1 carry-on, and 1 personal item <strong>and all bags are free</strong>. With that said, arrive at the airport early because everyone has 3+ bags each person. Other airlines will charge more than 150 dollars more just for one checked bag. Another reason why Turkish Airlines is great is that if you have an overnight stay, they offer free hotels for those who stay in Istanbul for 1 night. You may have to purchase a 30 dollar visa per person but the hotels are fantastic and breakfast is included all for free.</p>

    <h4> Covid-19 Requirements </h4> 
        <p><a href="https://www.collinsongroup.com/en/covid-19-testing/dallas-fort-worth-airport">Covid-19 testing</a> is quite simple to get at DFW Airport. The Antigen test is only 79 dollars and takes only 25 minutes to receive. This test will get you past checking and security in Istanbul as well as Italy. The testing site is located at Terminal D before security. Collinson is very fast and cheaper than most clinics if you don’t have the time or health insurance. In Italy, the antigen test is around 20 euros which is much cheaper and the time is also 20 minutes to wait. Be sure to have a passport for both visits at the airport and clinic.</p>

    <h4> What to Expect </h4> 
       <p>While in line at the airport, there are several documents needed to get pass checking and security. At DFW airport you will need: <br>
        <ul> 
        <strong>  
            <li>valid passport</li>
            <li>negative Covid-19 test</li>
            <li>boarding pass</li>
            <li><a href="https://app.euplf.eu/#/"> online EUPLF</a> (do online check-in before because you will need seat numbers to complete)</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2021/03/modulo_rientro_sintetico_05_marzo_2021_eng_compilabile.pdf"> self- declaration form</a></li>
        </ul>   
        </strong>
        <br>
       
       <p> After checking in your bags, head to security and the only items you will need are the boarding pass and passport. At the gate, you will need the same items: passport, boarding pass, and negative Covid-19 test. Now that you have boarded the airplane, it is time to enjoy your flight with Turkish Airlines. After you have boarded the plane to fly to Istanbul, I assure you will have the most amazing experience on the Turkish Airlines aircraft. The aircraft entertainment is the best. You will have music, tv, audiobooks, games, and more in front of your seat. You will be fed multiple times, normally dinner, breakfast, and lunch and it’s a good variety of food and drinks. Turkish Airlines is known for the food that you will receive on the flight so most likely you will not be disappointed.</p>

       <p> When you arrive at Istanbul Airport, in my opinion, it is the cleanest and fanciest airport I have ever been to. There are plenty of choices for food and even hotels and lounges inside the airport. If you are staying at the airport overnight there are two choices to make. You can either <strong>stay at the airport</strong> or <strong>take a shuttle and enjoy the free night at a hotel</strong>. 
    
<br>
<br>
       If you stay at the airport, it’s a little hard to sleep comfortably. They do have multiple chargers for your electronics and the internet is only 6 dollars per day. This choice will get you past security and you will not need to purchase a visa.<br> The other choice is to leave the airport and go to a hotel. Turkish Airlines offers a free shuttle and hotel. These hotels are very nice and clean. However, you will need to purchase a 30 dollar visa per person/passport. This could get expensive if you have 5+ people traveling with you. Other than that you will be taken care of at the hotel and given a time for your shuttle back to the airport. You will need the same documents to get through airport security and wait for the plane at your gate.</p>

    <h4>Arriving to Marco Polo Airport</h4> 
       <p>When you arrive at Marco Polo Airport or any airport in Italy, they will ask to see your passport, negative Covid test, and self-declaration form. There are no Ubers so you will have to take a taxi, water taxi, or bus to get to your destination. Or if you know someone in Venice, they can simply pick you up from the airport.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h1>Leaving to DFW Airport</h1> <a name= "Arrival_DFW"> </a> <h4>Traveling Back to DFW Airport</h4> 
      <p>The most efficient steps to successfully leave Italy back to the United States. You need a negative Covid-19 test within 48 hours of your arrival to the United States. You can receive the test at <a href="https://www.veneziaairport.it/en/info-and-assistance/swab-test-covid-19.html">Marco Polo Airport Covid testing.</a> Or you can find a nearby pharmacy that is under 30 euros.</p>
